	 * This hashCode() implementation violates an important property: 
	 * - The id changes during the lifetime of the object: before being 
	 *   persisted, the id is not set (so null). During invocation of the 
	 *   persist method, the id is provided by the ORM provider. After being 
	 *   persisted, the id is immutable (as a good id is being supposed to 
	 *   behave).
	 * - The result of this violation is that if the entities are used as keys 
	 *   in a HashSet or HashMap, they will become lost when being persisted.
	 * 
	 * This is the equals() implementation taken from
	 * http://www.onjava.com/pub/a
	 * /onjava/2006/09/13/dont-let-hibernate-steal-your-identity.html?page=1 
	 * (see Netbeans project EqualsHashCodeTryOut).

	 * This equals() implementation is meant for entities with *surrogate id*,
	 * where the id is provided by the ORM provider upon invocation of the
	 * persist method. This means that there is a period between object creation
	 * and persisting of the entity, where the id is not set and therefore null.
	 * 
	 * The properties are as follows:
	 * - if two non-persisted entities are compared, they are by definition 
	 *   unequal. This allow storing them in a set, even before being persisted. 
	 * - if two persisted entities are compared, they are compared based on their 
	 *   surrogate id (no other information from the object is used). 
	 * - if a persisted an a non-persisted entity are compared, they are by 
	 *   definition unequal.
